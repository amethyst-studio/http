## About The Project

Internal Amethyst Studio HTTP/s infrastucture and orchestration. Not designed for public use. Allows for transparent audits and ease of secure control.

Join our [Community Discord Server](https://invite-to.amethyst.live) for real-time support and developer feedback.

## Built With

The latest and greatest up-to-date technologies allow us to ensure that your project flows unhindered by upstream dependencies. With full strict testing protocol and release cycles, you can entrust your reliance on our technology stacks.

* [Node.js for Scripting](https://nodejs.org)
* [Docker for Container Orchestration](https://docker.com)
* [Caddy Server for HTTP Server](https://caddyserver.com)
* [Trunk for Linting](https://trunk.io)

## Getting Started

This is used internally by our organization. Self-hosting is not supported nor recommended.

## Usage

If you need more assistance, please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/amethyst-studio/http/discussions) to chat with us or join our [Community Discord Server](https://invite-to.amethyst.live) for real-time support.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/amethyst-studio/http/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are absolutely appreciated.

If you have suggestions for adding or removing from the project, please open a discussion with us first to ensure the scope of the project is upheld. If you want to work on an issue, look for the "State: Help Wanted" label and leave a comment saying you are going to try and take it on!

Some tips for the smooth flow of contribution:

1. Take a look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/amethyst-studio/.github/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/amethyst-studio/github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting to make your contributions. This will help smooth the workflow and adjustments needed to submitted contributions.
2. Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar and ensure that your code is clean and formatted to the project standard (Airbnb).
3. Ensure that you create an individual pull request for each suggestion. Lumping large changes together will require you to rework them into individual changes.

### Creating A Pull Request

1. Create a fork of the project.
2. Check into your feature, fix, or refactor branch. The `/issue_id` is optional if no issue is related to this branch's work.
    1. `git checkout -b feat/username/issue_id`
    2. `git checkout -b fix/username/issue_id`
    3. `git checkout -b refactor/username/issue_id`
3. Commit your changes incrementally, or as a single commit. Incremental commits are preferred for reviewability.
    1. `git commit -m "feat: some new feature"`
    2. `git commit -m "fix: fixed some issue"`
4. Push to the branch you are working in.
    1. `git push origin <branch_name_from_above>`

Finally, open a pull request and fill out the supplied template. After that, one of our contributors will review or approve your changes. Following that, your contribution will land in a later commit once a release window is ready. Usually, this is within 5 days of the contribution being officially accepted.
